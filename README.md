# Package-Database-Sorter
### By Jay Moon and Ryan Sheppard
This was a grade 12 project produced for the end of the year culminating performance task. The reason why we beleive that this was a better program to do over the games that everybody else is coding is because this program hits all the criteria from each unit a lot more inuitively. This program naturally requires each criteria so we aren't forcing criteria into our program. Overall, from the time that we were passing by the loading docks of a shipping company all the way until the night before we finished this program, it has been a challenging task filled with unexpected problems and furthermore unexpected ways to code something. Some new tasks that we learned through this program were:

1. The fact that the Java SDK has it's own sorting libraries already installed. This proved to be a more efficient way to sort each category in the databaseBuild.java table.
2. We imported and used an external API. Learning how to make calls to an API was a little different from the methods that we are used to through self coded projects so this was obviously a new task that we had to handle. 
3. The difference between classes, objects, static modifiers, public and private variables, and constructor variables became very evident while coding this project.
